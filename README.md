# Laravel Docker Template (PHP 8.2 + Local MySQL)

This is a lightweight Laravel 10 development environment using **Docker for PHP** and **MySQL from your local machine**.  
You don't need to install PHP or Composer on your host system.

The app runs via `php artisan serve` inside the container and connects to your **locally installed MySQL**.

## ‚úÖ Features

- Laravel 10 with PHP 8.2 (Dockerized)
- Uses `php artisan serve` (no Nginx needed)
- Connects to local MySQL (e.g. XAMPP, MAMP, Homebrew, etc.)
- Devs can define their own port using `.env`
- Great for teams with multiple developers

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### 1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone <REPO_URL> laravel-docker
cd laravel-docker
```

### 2. Copy .env and update config
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Then edit the .env file:

```env
APP_PORT=8010   # Any available port on your machine

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=host.docker.internal
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=root
```
üß† On Linux, use 172.17.0.1 instead of host.docker.internal


### 3. Start the container
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
This will build the container and run Laravel on the port you set.
Then open in your browser:
```bash
http://localhost:{APP_PORT}
```
Replace {APP_PORT} with the port you set in .env



### 4. Install Laravel dependencies (first-time only)
```bash
docker compose exec app 
composer install
```
This will install dependencies into the vendor/ directory
Run this only once after cloning the project

### 5. Use Artisan commands
```bash
docker compose exec app bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```
